## Step 1: Venture into the depths of hell

_Only the bravest dare its horrifying onslaughts._

You will need the following materials:
Fire-resistant clothing, 
a water bottle,
a large blanket,
earplugs,
a sacred weapon of choice,
and one large bag of various insects.

## Step 2: Find a _Malus furbica_ nest

**This is important:** If the guardian is present, you must follow the custom
and offer one finger or toe as a sacrifice. **DO NOT** attempt to bypass the guardian
unless you enjoy when monstrosities slurp up your entrails like spaghetti.

## Step 3: Accept an egg

The guardian will allow you to take one furby egg from its nest.
You will need to place it in the blanket until it hatches, 
at which point you will need to feed it bugs from your bag.

## Step 4: World domination
